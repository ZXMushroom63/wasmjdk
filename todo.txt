- [ ] port `jdk/src/hostspot/os_cpu/linux_arm/linux_arm_32.S` to wasm (probably just reimpl in C, its easier)
  - [ ] see if i can just steal from aarch64 or riscV
- [ ] get it to compile to a static library (at least somewhat)
- [ ] figure out how to make the binary compatible with a browser (probably just expose int main())
- [ ] wasm-opt eventually
